<p>Born and raised in Raleigh,NC, I enjoy learning and pushing myself. I have 4 dogs, love video games, obssessed with Game of Thrones and like to try new foods and experiences.</p>

<p>At home I have 4 Bouvier Des Flanders. They are large, hairy dogs originally from Holland/Belgium that were bred to herd cattle and pull carts. They are Awesome!</p>
